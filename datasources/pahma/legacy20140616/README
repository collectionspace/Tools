The code in this directory extracts data from PAHMA CSpace into csv files.

It was originally intended to provision the Delphi system, and the query exracts fields used by that system.

However, it is currently used to provision the Solr4 datasources used by PAHMA (and other UCB deployments)

To run the ad hoc ETL  used in the pahma solr datasource, do the following in this directory:

$ ./makeCsv2.sh pahma

or, via crontab, something like the following:

[jblowe@pahma-dev pahma]$ crontab -l
0 3 * * * /home/developers/pahma/makeCsv2.sh pahma >> /home/developers/pahma/extract.log.txt  2>&1

The script does the following:

* Extracts via sql the metadata needed for each object
* Extracts via sql the media (blob) metadata needed for each object
* Merges the two (i.e. adds the blob csid as a multivalued field to the metadata file
* Clears out the ucject-metadata solr4 core
* Loads the merged .csv file into solr.

The script currently take about 20 minutes to run.

Caveats:

- the query, its results, and the resulting solr datasource are largely unverified. Caveat utilizator.

- Most of the fields extracted are empty (i.e. no CSpace data is extracted from them).  
However, many of these are empty in the original extract as well.

- There are many different notes and remarks fields in the format. I'm not sure which,
of these to try to map to CSpace data.

- Fields which still need to be extracted (in progress): Dimensions

- Note that the ComponentNumber and ComponentName fields *could* be filled in using the
ObjectNumber and ObjectName fields -- in CSpace the distinction is formally expressed using
the Object hierarchy, and that distinction is not being capture in the output file. 
Perhaps it should?

- The mappings should be checked. For example, there are Delphi columns for Provenance, SiteName, 
and SiteNumber, but CSpace's Field Collection Place was mapped only to the first of these. 
CSpace's Ethnographic File Code was mapped to Purpose. Etc.

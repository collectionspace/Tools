this is the prototype solr4 datasource ETL for botgarden.

It does the following:

* Extracts live and Dead accessions via two SQL queries.
* Massages the extract to make sure it will load into solr4
* Loads it into the botgarden-metadata solr4 core, which is assumed to be up and available on localhost.

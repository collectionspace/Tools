To run the ad hoc ETL  used in the ucjeps solr datasource, do the following in this directory:

$ ./solrETL-public.sh ucjeps

or, via crontab, something like the following (assumes the job is running under user apache):

[jblowe@ucjeps ~]$ sudo crontab -u apache -l
0 2 * * * /home/developers/ucjeps/solrETL-public.sh ucjeps >> /home/developers/ucjeps/solrExtract.log  2>&1

The script does the following:

* Extracts via sql the metadata needed for each object
* Extracts via sql the media (blob) metadata needed for each object
* Merges the two (i.e. adds the blob csid as a multivalued field to the metadata file
* Clears out the ucjeps-public solr4 core
* Loads the merged .csv file into solr.

The script currently take about 20 minutes to run.

Caveats:

- the query, its results, and the resulting solr datasource are largely unverified. Caveat utilizator.
- the script assumes that the password for the reader user is in .pgpass; add it to the connect string in
  the script if it isn't.

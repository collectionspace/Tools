To run the ad hoc ETL  used in the ucjeps solr datasource, do the following in this directory:

$ ./makeCsv2.sh ucjeps

or, via crontab, something like the following:

[jblowe@pahma-dev pahma]$ crontab -l
0 3 * * * /home/developers/ucjeps/makeCsv2.sh ucjeps >> /home/developers/ucjeps/extract.log.txt  2>&1

The script does the following:

* Extracts via sql the metadata needed for each object
* Extracts via sql the media (blob) metadata needed for each object
* Merges the two (i.e. adds the blob csid as a multivalued field to the metadata file
* Clears out the ucject-metadata solr4 core
* Loads the merged .csv file into solr.

The script currently take about 20 minutes to run.

Caveats:

- the query, its results, and the resulting solr datasource are largely unverified. Caveat utilizator.

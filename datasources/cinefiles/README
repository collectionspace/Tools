These tables are created as denormalized data sources for the CineFiles web site.

Those that end in *string.sql are intermediate tables that have the concatenated strings of repeating information produced by corresponding Postgres functions.

These are all tables, despite the "view" names.  These were named like their Sybase ancestors in order to minimize changes in Java.

filmlist_view.sql and doclist_view.sql are the two primary sources, and filmdocs.sql is a many-to-many table that can be used to join them.  There are a few tables that are also used as primary data sources in the CineFiles web site (e.g., alldoctitles_view, allfilmtitles_view, docsubjects_view, filmgenres)

The startup script for Tomcat/CollectionSpace requires some per/instance 
variables to be set to appropriate values.

Check the setenv.sh file for CATALINA_HOME, JAVA_HOME, and database passwords.
Those fields will need to be set to something useful.

The main script (.sudo/runtc) is written to include stopping and starting an
Apache server. If CollectionSpace is not being run behind an Apache frontend
then set APACHE=NO in the .sudo/runtc file.


The files (except "cspace") will need to have their ownership changed
after being installed.

chown tomcat:tomcat setenv.sh runtc .sudo/runtc
chown root:tomcat .sudo

The "cspace" file is a sysv init script that can be installed as a way of
running CollectionSpace at boot-time. It should work on RHEL 5 or 6. The 
location of CATALINA_HOME may need to be adjusted.

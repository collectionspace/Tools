This is a custom build of goog.ui.DatePicker with dependencies (using compiler 
with SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATION). To rebuild you will need to

- check out google closure tools from
  http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

- use out google Closure compiler from
  http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/
  
and run the following command with adjusted paths to the resources
according to your filesystem:

${closure-library-read-only}/bin/calcdeps.py -i goog.ui.DatePicker.Require.js -p ${closure-library-read-only} -o compiled -c compiler.jar -f "--compilation_level=SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS" > goog.ui.DatePicker.js

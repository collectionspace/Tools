# Scripts to help with maintaining iReports on CSpace servers.
#
# these shell scripts have been tested on IST RHEL Linux boxes.
#
# they help you add, delete, enumerate, and configure iReport files.
# they depend on the user setting two environment variables specifying
# the server and credentials they wish to target.
#
# to target different servers, simply make different config files
# and source them as needed.
#
# using this technique, it is possible to update any CSpace server
# you have the credentials for from one place.
#
# Some Important Caveats
#
# 1. the script assumes that the user is authorized to scp files
#    into the tomcat report directory. This may require that 
#    chown/chgrp the .jasper files on the target servers.
#    Otherwise, you may have to accomplish this copy step
#    by hand.
#
# 2. the scripts attempt to record activity in a log file.
#    this is easily defeated if you modify or update reports
#    by other means (manually, or from another server)
#
# THE SCRIPTS
#
#  set-config-default.sh      basic environment var setting script
#  load-report.sh report "report name" "forDocType" copies .jasper file, configures report
#  delete-report.sh csid     deletes report having specified csid (deletes config only!)
#  list-reports.sh > reports.csv  lists the reports installed
#  delete-all-reports.sh reports.csv deletes all the reports listed in reports.csv
# 
# EXAMPLES
#
# script to set environment variables.
# this should be customized for the systems you are using.

$ cat set-config-default.sh 
#!/bin/bash
#
export REPORTURL="http://xxx.cspace.berkeley.edu:8180"
export REPORTUSER="xxx@xxx.cspace.berkeley.edu:xxx"
echo
echo ">>>>> Environment variables set:"
echo REPORTURL  $REPORTURL
echo REPORTUSER $REPORTUSER
echo

# copy the default config file.
$ cp set-config-default.sh set-pahma-dev.sh

# edit it so that it has the values for the system you want to work with.
$ vi set-pahma-dev.sh 

# source it to set the environment variables
$ source set-pahma-prod.sh 

>>>>> Environment variables set:
REPORTURL pahma.cspace.berkeley.edu
REPORTUSER xxxx@pahma.cspace.berkeley.edu:xxxx

# now go to town!

# load and config report (assumes you have a file zzz.jasper in this directory)
$ ./load-report.sh zzz "example" ""
zzz.jasper -- not found.

# put the .jasper file where it belongs (use this command when you have modified the report)
# but it still works the same.
sudo cp zzz.jasper /usr/local/share/apache-tomcat-6.0.33/cspace/reports/

# make a list of installed reports
$ ./list-reports.sh > listofreports.csv

$ cat listofreports.csv
74c64b69-40c6-4f36-9638	Group Report with sites and locations
f45de201-3429-4d67-a1b2	Basic Object Report
c82b4c85-88ac-4b20-90d1	Basic Group Report

# delete a report (e.g. the Basic Group Report above)
./delete-report.sh c82b4c85-88ac-4b20-90d1

# Scripts to help with maintaining iReports on CSpace servers.
#
# these shell scripts have been tested on IST RHEL Linux boxes.
#
# they help you add, delete, enumerate, and configure iReport files.
# they depend on the user setting two environment variables specifying
# the server and credentials they wish to target.
#
# to target different servers, simply make different config files
# and source them as needed.
#
# using this technique, it is possible to update any CSpace server
# you have the credentials for from one place.
#
# Some Important Caveats
#
# 1. the script assumes that the user is authorized to scp files
#    into the tomcat report directory. This may require that 
#    chown/chgrp the .jasper files on the target servers.
#    Otherwise, you may have to accomplish this copy step
#    by hand.
#
# 2. the scripts attempt to record activity in a log file.
#    this is easily defeated if you modify or update reports
#    by other means (manually, or from another server)
#
# THE SCRIPTS
#
#  set-config-default.sh      basic environment var setting script
#  load-report.sh report "report name" "forDocType" copies .jasper file, configures report
#  delete-report.sh csid     deletes report having specified csid (deletes config only!)
#  list-reports.sh > reports.csv  lists the reports installed
#  delete-all-reports.sh reports.csv deletes all the reports listed in reports.csv
# 
# EXAMPLES
#
# this script fetches a report that takes no parameters (e.g. ucbgVoucherLabel) using a dummy payload
#
# takes the csid of the report and the name of a pdf file to create.

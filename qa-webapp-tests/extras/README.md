# Q&D to read the CSpace wiki page where progress on UI testing is recorded.

 millions of caveats, too numerous to list here. wysiwyg!

Directions:

1. save 'https://wiki.collectionspace.org/display/collectionspace/Testing+Tasks+Release+4.3' on your local
   system as, say, 'qa1.html'

2. python qa.py qa1.html > qastatus.html

(you have to save the page from a browser because the javascript in the page must be executed to
set the values; if you just wget or curl the page, this does not happen.)

A copy of the pagei (testpage.html), saved as it was "in progress" during v4.3 testing, is 
included for demo purposes.

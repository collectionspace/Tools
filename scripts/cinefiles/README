This QC suite check files (either in directories in CSpace) on the assumption that they are
properly constructed TIFF images as used in cinefiles.

See BAMPFA-113 for the requirements, etc. of this suite.

This script operates in one of two modes:

* 'db' mode, where the blob list is created from a supplied date range and the blobs are
  expected in the local filesystem in CSpace.

* 'dir' mode, where the user supplies a directory containing files to check.

To invoke:

python checkBlobs.py db  cinefilesProd '2014-02-06 17:55:31'  '2014-02-06 18:16:53' report.csv
python checkBlobs.py dir /ftp/dir report.csv

i.e.

python checkBlobs.py db  config-file-no-extension start-date end-date report.csv
python checkBlobs.py dir directory report.csv

where:

datasource = db | dir (if db, get list from database, if dir, use supplied directory)
config-file-no-extension = configuration file for CSpace server, in "webapp format" (i.e. .cfg file)
start-date, end-date = two timestamps, can be just dates (times not required)
directory = full path to directory containing image files.

the most recent report:

nohup time python checkBlobs.py db cinefilesProd '2010-01-01' '2014-02-25' report2010on.csv &

The script takes about 15 minutes to produce a report for all 139K images in cinefiles as of this date.

The shell script monthly.sh does the following:
 - produces a report on images updated in CSpace during the the previous month (used updatedAt). 
   The report is called image_qc_report-yyy-mm.csv
 - extracts a list of the images that failed the QC checks, named image_qc_report-yyy-mm.problems.csv
 - compresses the monthly report, and emails both documents to the email address specified in the first argument.
 - invoke as: ./monthly recipient-list@berkeley.edu

Notes:

A directory called tiffs/ contains 3 test files is provided. 
To use it, try: python checkBlobs.py dir tiffs test.csv

This "suite" is installed at cinefiles.cspace.berkeley.edu:/home/developers/qc

The monthly script runs there with the following cron spec:

00 03 1 * * /home/developers/qc/monthly.sh cinefiles_reports@lists.berkeley.edu

i.e. run at 3AM on the first of each month, email to cinefiles_reports@lists.berkeley.edu

monitorImageCache.sh is a script to monitor the size of the imageserver caches.

It can be run via cron using something like the following:

0 4 * * * cd ~ ; ./monitorImageCache.sh "/tmp/image_cache/"  > report.txt 2>&1 ; cat report.txt | mail -s "ucjeps cache status" -- jblowe@berkeley.edu

...in which case it will email a report at 4 in the morning...

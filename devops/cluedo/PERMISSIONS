Hello, 

I am a developer for a museum collection management system.

We are developing a "test museum" for use in software testing, and we are thinking of using Cluedo as a "model museum". 

It has all the qualities of a museum: objects locations in places with people associated with them.

Would it be possible to use your images of, e.g. the weapons, in our test database? We would of course cite you as the source.?

Sincerely,

John B. Lowe, PhD

PAHMA webapps

v1.0 jbl 01/27/2013

Very short, terse, sketchy notes.

Currently there are 5 webapps in use by PAHMA:

SystematicInventory
KeyInfoRev
BarCodePrint
BarCodeUpload
PackingList

and two in development for UCBG:

BedList
LocationReport

These are all implemented as a single python CGI script, cswaMain.py. 

When this script (and its associated modules and config files) are installed in a directory that is execute-enabled for a webserver (e.g. in cgi-bin with a suitably configured Apache server), it will read the config specified in the "webapp=" parameter and perform the appropriate application activity.

E.g. entering:

    http://dev.cspace.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/cswaMain.py?webapp=packlistDev

will display the initial screen for the UCB-PAHMA webapp, in development mode, as specified in the config file named packlistDev.cfg. 

The script communicates with the backend database via either via pgdb (i.e. direct postgres queries) or via the rest API; the CSpace server to and credentials a configured in the .cfg file.

The config file specifies:

- what webapp to be (i.e. what header to print, what actions to perform, look-and-feel settings)
- postgres credentials
- cspace credentials
- other configuration details: directories to read/write files, etc.

The organization and values in the config files are pretty much self-explanatory.

To deploy (these steps have never been performed as a real deployment...):

- git the webapps directory from to your local machine ("git clone 
- cd cfg; change "xxxinsertpasswordherexxx" to appropriate values in the various cfg/.cfg files you intend to to use.
- cd py;
- ensure the required python modules are installed and available to scripts (pgdb, lxml, ConfigParser, perhaps others)
- ensure jQuery is installed and available in ../js and ../css on the web server (jQuery is used by the "term matching" (autosuggest) feature).
- put the other .css and .js files are in the appropriate locations. Currently there are three files required, and *NB*: these are not in github!
    jquery-1.7.2.min.js
    jquery-ui-1.8.22.custom.css
    jquery-ui-1.8.22.custom.min.js
  (these last two are the "basic" autocomplete components from http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/)
- copy all the files in cfg/ and py/ to the server executable directory (e.g. /var/www/cgi-bin) with appropriate permissions 
  (cswaMain.py and autosuggest.py need to be executable. The .cfg files need to be readable by the scripts)
- ensure that your webserver is configured to execute python scripts.
- some of the webapps expect to write files (logs, barcode files, etc.). These files may need to be initials and their permissions set.

Of course, most of the webapps expect to access a CSpace system customized for PAHMA, and will probably not work if pointed to any other!

If you have problems, here's a very short troubleshooting guide:

- once you have what you think is a working setup, ssh to the server, cd to the CGI directory and try to execute the main module from the command line:
   $ python cswaMain.py "webapp=keyinfoDev"
  this should display html on the screen. If it does not, it should display a helpful python error message!
- if you open the webapp in a browser and see nothing, or an incomplete page, look in the webserver error (often something like /var/logs/httpd/error_log).
- indeed, in general, consult the log if you have problems: the program write messages to stderr from time to time.

This code runs on dev.cspace and has never been tried anywhere else. There is no formal testing or deployment apparatus beyond what is here. Many development choices were predicated on being self-sufficient and constrained by the security and resource environment present on the server on which it runs.

Caveat Utilizator!

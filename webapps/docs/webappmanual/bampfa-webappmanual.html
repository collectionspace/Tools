      <h3 class="subheader">Introduction</h3>
      <p>The webapps are a suite of browser-based tools which access the CollectionSpace database to provide critical functionality not provided by the "regular" interface.</p>
      <p>In general, the webapps operate on <i>sets of records</i>, a set
  being defined as something like "all objects in a range of Museum numbers", e.g.,
  "1995.12.1" TO "1992.12.9", or "all objects in a location or sequence of
  locations" (e.g. "Collection Storage, 01A" to "Collection Storage,
  03B"). Typical operations performed are updating certain fields for those sets of records, or creating move or inventory actions for them.</p>
      <p>Besides move and data update operations, a few other webapps provide a means to print barcodes and view database content (e.g., authority hierarchies) in useful ways.</p>
      <p>There are two classes of webapps in use at BAMPFA:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Procedural webapps, which move objects and crates to other locations; and support uploading media.</li>
        <li>Reporting webapps, which return information about the collection (and do not change any data).</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="subheader">Short Description of Each Webapp</h3>
      <p>A screenshot of each of these is provided below with a short description of its operation.  </p>
      <center>
        <h4>1. Producedural Webapps</h4>
        <hr/>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td style="page-break-before:avoid">
              <div><a href="bamInventorinator2.png"><img src="bamInventorinator2.png" width="600px"/></a></div>
              <p>This webapp allows registrars to reconcile the results of a (normally physical) inventory. User enters a <i>range</i> of storage locations and the objects in those locations are displayed; the user can then indicate (using the radio buttons) whether the object is indeed located or not. Other reports or the regular UI can be used to follow up on the objects that were not located.  [<i>NB: There is a printed "Systematic Inventory" PDF report, generated by iReport, that can be used alongside this webapp. The Systematic Inventory webapp is essentially an editable version of this PDF report. Data entry can be done quite quickly, in large part due to the close similarity of the two documents.</i>] </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="page-break-before:avoid">

              <div><a href="2-pm-before.png"><img src="2-pm-before.png" width="600px"/></a></div>
              <p>This webapp allows registrars, collections managers, and conservators to record the movement of a box or other container&#x2014;and all of its contained objects&#x2014;to a new storage location. The user must specify the box, crate, or container name, its current storage location, and the desired new storage location. The user can choose to exclude any objects from the planned move (for instance, if objects were removed just prior to the planned move) by selecting the "Not Found" radio button.  Once "Move Objects" is clicked, all displayed objects not marked as "Not Found" will be recorded as having been moved to the new storage location, while remaining in their current box. Objects marked as "Not Found" will have their new location set to "Not Found," and will have to have their actual current location manually set in the CSpace UI. This webapp can also be used to inventory the contents of a box or crate, as it performs the same functionality as the Systematic Inventory webapp, but allows selection of a single box, rather than all boxes and all objects at a specific location.</p>

          <tr>
            <td style="page-break-before:avoid">

              <div><a href="bampfaBMU.png"><img src="bampfaBMU.png" width="600px"/></a></div>
              <p>This webapp uploads media files (usually images) to
  CollectionSpace. The user selects a set of files on their local
  computer (using the "Choose Files" button) and then uploads these to the CSpace server. They are then "ingested" into CSpace via a nightly import job.  There is an option to perform the ingestion process online, but since the process is slow -- several seconds at least per image -- the usual practice is to use the nightly batch option.</p>

              <div><a href="1-packinglist.png"><img src="1-packinglist.png" width="600px"/></a></div>
              <p>This webapp produces both packing lists and decanting lists, and offers PDF and CSV options for both. For packing lists, a range of storage locations is entered, and a list of all objects at those locations is generated, grouped by current storage location. To restrict this list to objects from a certain place or continent, a collection place can be specified. To produce decanting lists that facilitate organizing objects by cultural group, the user need only check the "group by culture" checkbox.</p>

      <h3 class="subheader">Foibles and Caveats</h3>
      The webapps have a number of foibles you should know about: 
      <ul>
        <li>Term matching for authority fields, e.g. Field Collection Place or Ethnographic Group may include terms from other vocabularies and non-preferred terms (however, deleted terms no longer show up.) In fact, the selection algorithm is a bit complicated. </li>
        <li>Term matching for museum numbers is on the literal value of the object number, but the range is calculated on the basis of the museum number sort field (which you cannot see, except when viewing the catalog record). </li>
        <li>For locations, however, both matching and ranges are based on the literal value (Locations do not have a sort field, they sort &#x201C;as themselves&#x201D;.) </li>
        <li>You do not have to enter an End Location. If you don&#x2019;t the app will use the Start Location and fill it in for you. </li>
        <li>Most of the webapps have a limit of 500 locations in a range, and 500 objects in a location. The Packing List is the exception: it will try to render the whole museum if you ask it. This value, incidentally, is based solely on the limitations of the &#x201C;average web browser&#x201D;.</li>

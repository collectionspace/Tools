      <h3 class="subheader">Introduction</h3>
      <p>The webapps are a suite of browser-based tools which access the CollectionSpace database to provide critical functionality not provided by the "regular" interface.</p>
      <p>In general, the webapps operate on <i>sets of records</i>, a set
  being defined as something like "all objects in a range of Museum numbers", e.g.,
  "1-100 to 1-105a", or "all objects in a location or sequence of
  locations" (e.g. "Kroeber 51A, 500, 13" to "Kroeber 51A, 500,
  23"). Typical operations performed are updating the data for sets of records, or creating move or inventory actions for them.</p>
      <p>Besides move and data update operations, a few other webapps provide a means to print barcodes and view database content (e.g., authority hierarchies) in useful ways.</p>
      <p>There are four classes of webapps in use at PAHMA:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Procedural webapps, which move objects and crates to other locations; and support upload media.</li>
        <li>Data update webapps, which update data elements in (mostly collectionobject) records.</li>
        <li>Reporting webapps, which return information about the collection (and do not change any data).</li>
        <li>Barcode webapps, which support the scanning and printing of barcode labels.</li>
      </ol>

              <p>This webapp allows registrars to reconcile the results of a (normally physical) inventory. User enters a <i>range</i> of storage locations and the objects in those locations are displayed; the user can then indicate (using the radio buttons) whether the object is indeed located or not. Other reports or the regular UI can be used to follow up on the objects that were not located.  [<i>NB: There is a printed "Systematic Inventory" PDF report, generated by iReport, that can be used alongside this webapp. The Systematic Inventory webapp is essentially an editable version of this PDF report. Data entry can be done quite quickly, in large part due to the close similarity of the two documents.</i>] </p>

              <p>This webapp allows registrars, collections managers, and conservators to record the movement of a specific range of Museum numbers to a new storage location (and a new crate, if so desired). Once the user has entered a range of Museum numbers, a new destination/storage location, a reason, and a handler and clicked "Search", all objects in that range of Museum numbers are displayed, along with their object names, counts, and current locations. The user can choose to exclude any objects in this range from the move by deselecting those objects using the provided checkboxes. Once "Move Selected Objects" is clicked, all non-excluded displayed objects will be recorded as having been moved to the new storage location.</p>

              <p>This webapp allows registrars, collections managers, and conservators to record the movement of a box or other container&#x2014;and all of its contained objects&#x2014;to a new storage location. The user must specify the box, crate, or container name, its current storage location, and the desired new storage location. The user can choose to exclude any objects from the planned move (for instance, if objects were removed just prior to the planned move) by selecting the "Not Found" radio button.  Once "Move Objects" is clicked, all displayed objects not marked as "Not Found" will be recorded as having been moved to the new storage location, while remaining in their current box. Objects marked as "Not Found" will have their new location set to "Not Found," and will have to have their actual current location manually set in the CSpace UI. This webapp can also be used to inventory the contents of a box or crate, as it performs the same functionality as the Systematic Inventory webapp, but allows selection of a single box, rather than all boxes and all objects at a specific location.</p>

              <p>This webapp uploads media files (usually images) to
  CollectionSpace. The user selects a set of files on their local
  computer (using the "Choose Files" button) and then uploads these to the CSpace server. They are then "ingested" into CSpace via a nightly import job.  There is an option to perform the ingestion process online, but since the process is slow -- several seconds at least per image -- the usual practice is to use the nightly batch option.</p>

              <p>This webapp allows registrars, curators, and subject matter experts to quickly verify, edit, and/or update values in several important fields (the so-called "key information fields"). The objects displayed in the KIR webapp are selected according to their storage location(s). Depending on the application (e.g., NAGPRA, physical inventory, retrospective cataloging), the identity of these key fields can vary, so the webapp accommodates different sets of&#x2014;and configurations of&#x2014;data fields. In most cases these are editable, but for some (e.g., Donor), the KIR webapp serves as a way to quickly determine the state of data entry and to identify particular records that need to be updated in the CSpace UI.</p>

              <p>As with the KIR webapp, the OIR webapp allows registrars, curators, and subject matter experts to quickly verify, edit, and/or update values in several important fields. The sets of "Key Information" fields are the same as in the KIR webapp. The only difference between KIR and OIR is that in the OIR webapp, a range of Museum numbers is used to select the objects (instead of a range of storage locations).</p>

              <p>As with the KIR and OIR webapps, the BOE webapp allows registrars, curators, and subject matter experts to quickly update values in several important fields. The sets of available "Key Information" fields are the same as in the KIR and the OIR webapps. The BOE webapp differs in one very important aspect from either KIR or OIR: the values in the fields to be updated are not displayed by the BOE webapp. The user must know in advance what the existing values of these fields are, and must also be certain that they want to override all values in a particular field with a single value that the user can enter into each field. The user can update several fields at once, or only a single field at a time.</p>

              <p>This webapp produces both packing lists and decanting lists, and offers PDF and CSV options for both. For packing lists, a range of storage locations is entered, and a list of all objects at those locations is generated, grouped by current storage location. To restrict this list to objects from a certain place or continent, a collection place can be specified. To produce decanting lists that facilitate organizing objects by cultural group, the user need only check the "group by culture" checkbox.</p>

              <p>This webapp allows users to see a visual representation of the organization of any of six hierarchical authorities (all but storage location). The desired hierarchy is calculated and displayed as a series of hierarchically nested facets, which are all set to be initially open. Users can click any facet arrow to collapse (or reopen) that facet, and can click on any term in the displayed hierarchy to see the corresponding full CSpace authority term record.</p>

              <p>This webapp was designed to give rapid access to basic information about&#x2014;and photos of&#x2014;any object in the collection, either by scanning the object's barcode or by manually entering a Museum number. This webapp was designed for use on an iPad, but it works equally well on any tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. The Object Details webapp can also be used on smart phones such as iPhones and Android phones.</p>

These metrics can be displayed in tabular form, or as pie charts or bar charts. To see how any metric has changed over time, the values of any chosen metric can also plotted against time (with the range of dates displayed also being fully customizeable). The data displayed by this webapp is updated nightly at 3:00am.</p>

These TriCoder files must first be renamed following this pattern: "TRIDATA_2014-07-16_comments.DAT". The ISO date must match the date that the file is uploaded using this webapp, even if the TriCoder data file contains movement data from other dates. The filename must also contain no spaces. Once a file has been selected and a move reason chosen, the user clicks "Upload" to upload the file. Once uploaded, an hourly cron script will detect and process the file, turning the TriCoder data into movement records in CSpace.</p>

Barcoded labels can be printed singly, or in large batches defined either by a range of Museum numbers or by a range of current storage locations. The user must specify a printer cluster (currently either Hearst Gym Basement or Marchant). If a storage location or range of storage locations has been specified, the user will be asked whether object labels or location labels should be printed.</p>

      <a id="foibles"/>
      <h3 class="subheader">Foibles and Caveats</h3>
      The webapps have a number of foibles you should know about: 
      <ul>
        <li>Term matching for authority fields, e.g. Field Collection Place or Ethnographic Group may include terms from other vocabularies and non-preferred terms (however, deleted terms no longer show up.) In fact, the selection algorithm is a bit complicated. </li>
        <li>Term matching for museum numbers is on the literal value of the object number, but the range is calculated on the basis of the museum number sort field (which you cannot see, except when viewing the catalog record). </li>
        <li>For locations, however, both matching and ranges are based on the literal value (Locations do not have a sort field, they sort &#x201C;as themselves&#x201D;.) </li>
        <li>You do not have to enter an End Location. If you don&#x2019;t the app will use the Start Location and fill it in for you. </li>
        <li>Most of the webapps have a limit of 500 locations in a range, and 500 objects in a location. The Packing List is the exception: it will try to render the whole museum if you ask it. This value, incidentally, is based solely on the limitations of the &#x201C;average web browser&#x201D;.</li>

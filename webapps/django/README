This is essentially an archetype for creating Django projects (websites) that are setup to run CollectionSpace related webapp applications.  It comes configured with one example webapp named "polls" that derives from the Django tutorial at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/.

It also comes configured with a "back-end" CollectionSpace authentication provider.  See the README.txt file in the /ucb_deployment_site/authn directory for instructions on setting it up.
